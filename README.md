This repo exists to serve a [website](https://cutonbuminband.github.io/counting-analysis) showcasing some of the things I've done with the [rcounting tools](https://github.com/cutonbuminband/rcounting). Go to the website or to the `rcounting` repository for more information; this README is intentionally left very short

## Dependencies

The website is published using the open-source [quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system built on top of pandoc. Go check it out - it's pretty nifty!
